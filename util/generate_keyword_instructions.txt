instructions:

- get keyword lists (syntax for windows cmd)
    cmake --help-property-list > property_list.txt
    cmake --help-command-list > command_list.txt
    cmake --help-variable-list > variable_list.txt

- remove blank lines (taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31412765/regex-to-remove-white-spaces-blank-lines-and-final-line-break-in-javascript)
    regex replace "^(?=\n)$|^\s*|\s*$|\n\n+" with ""

- replace line feeds with carriage return + line feed + | (\r\n for windows, | for textmate regex)
    replace "\n" with "\r\n|"

replace variable string (i.e. <CONFIG>) with regex equivalent
    regex replace "<[^\s]+>" with "\\w+"

- copy generated keyword lists into relevent areas in .tmlanguage file
    - preserve (?x) of regex to allow regex to span multiple lines (easier to track changes in git)
    - preserve other special characters at start and end of regex to ensure it works

limitations:

- does not split variable between:
    "Variables That Change Behavior"
    "Variables That Describe the System"
    "Variables that Control the Build"
- so have put them all in new:
    "Variables"

- does not split properties between:
    "Properties on Cache Entries"
    "Properties on Source Files"
    "Properties on Tests"
    "Properties on Directories"
    "Properties of Global Scope"
    "Properties on Targets"
- so have put them all in new
    "Properties"

- gave Properties name:
    "variable.source.cmake"
- instead of:
    "entity.source.cmake"
- because latter was just white
